-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-Super duper easy way to release your Android and other artifacts to bintray.
-
-
-## Description
-
-This is a helper for releasing libraries to bintray. It is intended to help configuring stuff related to maven and bintray.
-At the moment it works with Android Library projects, plain Java and plain Groovy projects, but our focus is to mainly support Android projects.
-
-## Adding to project
-
-To publish a library to bintray using this plugin, add these dependencies to the `build.gradle` of the module that will be published:
-
-```groovy
-apply plugin: 'com.novoda.bintray-release' // must be applied after your artifact generating plugin (eg. java / com.android.library)
-
-buildscript {
-    repositories {
-        jcenter()
-    }
-    dependencies {
-        classpath 'com.novoda:bintray-release:<latest-version>'
-    }
-}
-```
-
-## Simple usage
-
-Use the `publish` closure to set the info of your package:
-
-```groovy
-publish {
-    userOrg = 'novoda'
-    groupId = 'com.novoda'
-    artifactId = 'bintray-release'
-    publishVersion = '0.6.1'
-    desc = 'Oh hi, this is a nice description for a project, right?'
-    website = 'https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release'
-}
-```
-
-If you use [Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) use:
-
-```kotlin
-import com.novoda.gradle.release.PublishExtension
-
-configure<PublishExtension> {
-  userOrg = "novoda"
-  groupId = "com.novoda"
-  artifactId = "bintray-release"
-  publishVersion = "0.6.1"
-  desc = "Oh hi, this is a nice description for a project, right?"
-  website = "https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release"
-}
-```
-
-Finally, use the task `bintrayUpload` to publish (make sure you build the project first!):
-
-```bash
-$ ./gradlew clean build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUser=BINTRAY_USERNAME -PbintrayKey=BINTRAY_KEY -PdryRun=false
-```
-
-More info on the available properties and other usages in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release/wiki).
-
-## Gradle compatibility
-
-The plugin officially supports only Gradle 4.0+
-
-## Snapshots
-[![CI status](https://ci.novoda.com/buildStatus/icon?job=bintray-release-snapshot)](https://ci.novoda.com/job/bintray-release-snapshot/lastBuild/console) [![Download from Bintray](https://api.bintray.com/packages/novoda-oss/snapshots/bintray-release/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/novoda-oss/snapshots/bintray-release/_latestVersion)
-
-Snapshot builds from [`develop`](https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release/compare/master...develop) are automatically deployed to a [repository](https://bintray.com/novoda-oss/snapshots/bintray-release/_latestVersion) that is **not** synced with JCenter.
-To consume a snapshot build add an additional maven repo as follows:
-```
-repositories {
-    maven {
-        url 'https://dl.bintray.com/novoda-oss/snapshots/'
-    }
-}
-```
-
-You can find the latest snapshot version following this [link](https://bintray.com/novoda-oss/snapshots/bintray-release/_latestVersion).

-This is a separate gradle project that is kept in the same VCS repository.
-If you want to checkout/use/test the samples - you should import this folder as a separate project.
-
-It is a separate project because gradle plugins need to be included as buildscript dependencies of the project using
-them, and this requires the use of a compiled artifact of the plugin.
-
-In order to streamline this process and avoid to play with manual local/remote releases we are making the `samples`
-project to compile its own local version of the plugin directly from its sources, leveraging the Gradle composite builds support.
-This allow us to instruct the `samples` project to resolve the `com.novoda:bintray-release:*` dependency using the output 
-of the plugin Gradle project.
-(For more info about composite builds [read this](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html))

-### Modules
-
-#### android
-
-This is an example project using the `bintray-release` plugin to release an Android library.
-
-#### jvm
-
-This is an example proect using the `bintray-release` plugin to release a Java library.

-# Swipe Layout
-
-Flexible Android Widget
-
-![sample](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/swipe-layout-android/blob/master/rambler.mail.gif?raw=true)
-
-## Download
-
-Download via Gradle:
-```groovy
-implementation 'ru.rambler.android:swipe-layout:1.1.0'
-```
-## Usage
-
-**Swipe Layout** may contain up to 3 children with **left**, **right** or **center** gravity attributes.
-
-You could disable swipe completely calling method `setSwipeEnabled(false)` or using XML-attribute `'app:swipe_enabled="false'`
-
-To disable swipe from one of the side you could use methods `setLeftSwipeEnabled(false)` and `setRightSwipeEnabled(false)` or via XML:
-
-```xml
-<ru.rambler.libs.swipe_layout.SwipeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
-    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
-    android:layout_width="match_parent"
-    android:layout_height="@dimen/item_height"
-    app:left_swipe_enabled="false"
-    app:right_swipe_enabled="true"/>
-```
-
-Full list of widget attributes can be found [here](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/swipe-layout-android/blob/develop/swipe-layout/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml).
-
-```xml
-<ru.rambler.libs.swipe_layout.SwipeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
-    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
-    android:layout_width="match_parent"
-    android:layout_height="@dimen/item_height">
-
-    <!--CENTER. app:gravity="center" - is default value -->
-    <LinearLayout
-        android:layout_width="match_parent"
-        android:layout_height="match_parent">
-        
-        ...
-    </LinearLayout>
-
-    <!--RIGHT-->
-    <LinearLayout
-        android:layout_width="match_parent"
-        android:layout_height="match_parent"

-
-    <!--LEFT-->
-    <FrameLayout
-        android:layout_width="200dp"
-        android:layout_height="match_parent"
-        app:gravity="left"
